# Generate_faces_using_Generative_Adversarial_Networks

The objective of this is to get hands-on experience with building and training a GAN for image generation. Learned about the concepts of adversarial loss, generator, and discriminator, and how to apply them to a real-world image generation task.

Dataset: The CelebA dataset is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images. Each image in the dataset is annotated with 40 binary attributes, such as "male", "eyeglasses", "smiling", etc. You will use this dataset to train the GAN and generate new, unique face images.
